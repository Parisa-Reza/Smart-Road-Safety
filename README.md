This hardware based project is ensuring road safety and making people abide by the traffic rules.
2 IR sensors will measure vehicle speed and show it on 16X4 LCD display. 
If the speed crosses a certain limit a webcam will capture the vehicle number plate photo and send it the authority via gmail. Google SMTP server has been used for this.
For traffic rules, when the light is red, spikes on the road will appear using servo motor. In contrast, the green light will let vehicles go making the road obstacle free
